# Dashboard

An optional tool to view your cc-company organization status in the browser.

## Installation & Usage

Run the following in a project that has a `.company/` folder:

```bash
npx cc-company-dashboard
```

A browser will automatically open at `http://localhost:3939` showing your dashboard.

### Options

```bash
npx cc-company-dashboard --port 4000    # Change port
npx cc-company-dashboard --no-open      # Disable auto browser open
npx cc-company-dashboard --dir /path    # Specify directory to search for .company/
```

## Real-time Updates

The dashboard watches the `.company/` folder. Changes made through `/company` are automatically reflected in the dashboard.

## Light / Dark Mode

Toggle with the ☀/☽ button in the top bar. Your preference is saved in the browser.

## Works Without Dashboard

The dashboard is optional. The `/company` secretary works perfectly fine without it.
